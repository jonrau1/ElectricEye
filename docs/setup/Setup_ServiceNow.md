## Configuring TOML

This section explains how to configure ElectricEye, a Python CLI tool that supports Cloud Asset Management (CAM), Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM), SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM), and External Attack Surface Management (EASM) capabilities across AWS, GCP, and ServiceNow, using a TOML configuration file. The configuration file contains settings for credentials, regions, accounts, and global settings and is located [here](../../eeauditor/external_providers.toml).

To configure the TOML file, you need to modify the values of the variables in the `[global]` and `[credentials.servicenow]` sections of the file. Here's an overview of the key variables you need to configure:

- `credentials_location`: Set this variable to specify the location of where credentials are stored and will be retrieved from. You can choose from AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (`AWS_SSM`), AWS Secrets Manager (`AWS_SECRETS_MANAGER`), or from the TOML file itself (`CONFIG_FILE`) which is **NOT** recommended.

- `servicenow_instance_name`: The name of your ServiceNow Instance. For example, if your ServiceNow URL is "https://dev90210.service-now.com/", the name is "dev90210".

- `servicenow_instance_region`: The geographic location of your ServiceNow Instance which will be provided to ProductFields.AssetRegion within the ElectricEye findings. This is typically `"us"`, `"eu"`, or `"ap"` and may differ for Federal instances.

- `servicenow_sspm_username`: The name of the ServiceNow User with permissions that will be used by the PySNOW Client.

- `servicenow_sspm_password_value`: The location (or actual contents) of the Password for the User specified in servicenow_instance_name. This location must match the value of global.credentials_location. For example, if you specify `"AWS_SSM"`, then the value for this variable should be the name of the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store SecureString Parameter.

- `servicenow_failed_login_breaching_rate`: The threshold for when to create a failing finding for the "ServiceNow_Users_Auditor" check for failed login-in attempts by active users in your ServiceNow Instance. The default value is "5".

## Use ElectricEye for ServiceNow

**Note:** Currently, ElectricEye SSPM for Servicenow relies on a User being created with a specific Role, in the future this may change to an OAuth or Integration User. Also, the Instructions to add the `admin` Role are over-permissive and will be scaled down properly for subsequent releases after testing.

1. In Servicenow create a new User with a `User ID` of `**electriceye_sspm**` and add the `admin` Role as an assignment.

2. Select **Set Password** and generate a password, create an AWS Systems Manager `SecureString` Parameter for this value.

```bash
export SNOW_PW_PARAMETER_NAME='cool_name_here'
aws ssm put-parameter \
    --name $SNOW_PW_PARAMETER_NAME \
    --description 'ElectricEye SSPM Servicenow Password for electriceye_sspm' \
    --type SecureString \
    --value $PLACEHOLDER
```

3. Set the value of **Password needs reset** to false and **Update** the User to save changes.


4. With >=Python 3.6 installed, install and upgrade `pip3` and setup `virtualenv`.

```bash
sudo apt install -y python3-pip
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install virtualenv --user
virtualenv .venv
```

5. This will create a virtualenv directory called `.venv` which needs to be activated.

```bash
#For macOS and Linux
. .venv/bin/activate

#For Windows
.venv\scripts\activate
```

6. Clone the repo and install all dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonrau1/ElectricEye.git
cd ElectricEye
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# if use AWS CloudShell
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```

7. Use the Controller to conduct different kinds of Assessments.

    - 7A. Retrieve all options for the Controller.

    ```bash
    python3 eeauditor/controller.py --help
    ```

    - 7B. Evaluate your entire ServiceNow instance.

    ```bash
    python3 eeauditor/controller.py -t Servicenow
    ```

    - 7C. Evaluate your ServiceNow instance against a specifc Auditor (runs all Checks within the Auditor).

    ```bash
    python3 eeauditor/controller.py -t Servicenow -a Servicenow_Users_Auditor
    ```

    - 7D. Evaluate your ServiceNow instance against a specific Check within any Auditor, it is ***not required*** to specify the Auditor name as well. The below examples runs the "[SSPM.Servicenow.AccessControl.1] Instance should block access to GlideSystemUserSession scriptable API unsanitized messages" check.

    ```bash
    python3 eeauditor/controller.py -t Servicenow -c servicenow_sspm_user_session_allow_unsanitzed_messages_check
    ```
